# Community Guidelines

This document outlines the expected behaviour when participating in the
Stellar Suite community (forums, comments, GitHub, etc.).  Maintaining a
civil, inclusive atmosphere helps everyone get more value from the project.

## Be Respectful

- Treat other users with courtesy and respect.
- Disagree constructively and avoid personal attacks.
- Remember that English may not be everyone’s first language; be patient.

## Stay On‑Topic

- Discussions should relate to Stellar Suite, Soroban, or the wider Stellar
ecosystem.
- Before opening a new thread, search existing topics to avoid duplicates.

## No Harassment or Hate Speech

- Harassment, bullying, discriminatory language, and hate speech are
  unacceptable.
- Content that targets individuals or groups based on race, gender, sexual
  orientation, religion, or other protected characteristics will be removed.

## Privacy and Security

- Do **not** share private keys, seed phrases, credentials, or any sensitive
  data in public discussions.
- If you need help with something that involves private information, open a
  support ticket so we can handle it securely.

## Reporting Issues

- Use the support ticket form for complaints, harassment reports, or content
  that violates these guidelines.
- Moderators will review reports and take appropriate action (warning,
  removal, or temporary bans).

## Contribution Etiquette

- Contributions to the codebase must follow the standard contribution
  guidelines in the main README (licensing, formatting, tests).
- Credit other contributors fairly and do not claim authorship for others’
  work.

## Have Fun!

- We’re all here because we enjoy building on Stellar and making tools to
  simplify development. Help one another and enjoy the community.
